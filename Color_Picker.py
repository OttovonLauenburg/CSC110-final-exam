Some interesting principles:

If R-value = G-value = B-valueï¼ˆFor example: 67 67 67 or 100 100 100),
the color it expressing is a kind of gray. The bigger value is, the more
bright the color it expressing is. Note:125 125 125 = Standard Gray

The smaller the difference between three values are, the darker the color
it expressing is.
